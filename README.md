# Website_Skiing
Project that I was working on over the third year at University of Organization and Informatics at Vara≈ædin. It is not finished 100% but it can show my work.

Project is about managing skiing resorts and creating excursions. There are four possible views: 
1. One is administrator who can manage moderators and configurte website settings 
2. Moderator can manage excurions and reservations
3. Registred user can view excurions, make and change reservastions and post multimedia in excursion gallery
4. Nonregisterd user can just view excursions and there galleries.
